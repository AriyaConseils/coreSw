/**
 * @class SwEventLoop
 * @brief A local event loop mechanism built on top of the SwCoreApplication fiber system.
 *
 * This class provides a local event loop similar to QEventLoop. It allows you to start a nested
 * event loop and block execution until `quit()` or `exit()` is called, at which point it returns
 * control back to the caller of `exec()`.
 *
 * @details
 * The SwEventLoop relies on the underlying fiber-based architecture of SwCoreApplication.
 * When `exec()` is called, it suspends the current fiber using `yieldFiber()` and waits until
 * `unYieldFiber()` is called elsewhere in the code (typically via `quit()` or `exit()`), causing
 * the event loop to resume and exit. This makes it possible to implement nested event loops,
 * modal dialogs, or short-lived waiting loops without blocking the entire application.
 *
 * ### Example Usage
 *
 * ```cpp
 * SwEventLoop loop;
 *
 * // Some code that posts an event to quit the loop later...
 * // For instance:
 * // SwCoreApplication::instance()->postEvent([&]() {
 * //     loop.quit();
 * // });
 *
 * // This call will block here until quit() or exit() is called
 * int returnCode = loop.exec();
 *
 * // At this point, the loop has stopped running and we have `returnCode`.
 * ```
 *
 * ### Key Methods
 * - `exec()`: Starts the event loop. Execution will be suspended until `quit()` or `exit()` is called.
 * - `quit()`: Stops the event loop and returns control to the caller of `exec()`.
 * - `exit(int code)`: Like `quit()`, but also sets an exit code that can be retrieved from `exec()`.
 * - `isRuning()`: Checks if the event loop is currently running.
 *
 * ### Internal Details
 * - `exec()` obtains a unique identifier for the event loop and yields the current fiber, effectively
 *   pausing execution. The fiber will only resume once `unYieldFiber()` is called with the corresponding
 *   identifier, which happens in `quit()` or `exit()`.
 * - When `quit()` is invoked, the event loop sets `running_` to `false` and triggers `unYieldFiber(id_)`,
 *   causing `exec()` to return.
 * - `exit(int code)` is similar to `quit()` but also sets an exit code, which `exec()` returns.
 *
 * @note Ensure that SwCoreApplication and its fiber system are properly initialized before using SwEventLoop.

    /**
     * @brief Blocks execution for a specified duration in milliseconds.
     *
     * This method provides a mechanism to pause execution for a given duration, while maintaining the
     * fiber-based architecture of the event loop. Depending on the context in which it is called,
     * it behaves as follows:
     *
     * - **If called from the main fiber** (before the event loop starts):
     *   - A blocking sleep is used via `std::this_thread::sleep_for`. This is a simple, synchronous
     *     blocking mechanism.
     * - **If called from a secondary fiber** (after the event loop has started):
     *   - A non-blocking mechanism is used:
     *     1. A one-shot timer (`SwTimer::singleShot`) is created, which schedules a callback to wake
     *        the current fiber after the specified duration.
     *     2. The current fiber is "yielded" (paused) using `SwCoreApplication::yieldFiber`.
     *     3. When the timer's callback triggers, the fiber is "un-yielded" using `SwCoreApplication::unYieldFiber`,
     *        allowing the fiber to resume execution.
     *
     * This approach ensures that other fibers and tasks can continue to execute during the pause,
     * maintaining responsiveness of the application.
     *
     * @param milliseconds Duration of the sleep in milliseconds.
     *
     * ### Workflow:
     * 1. Determine whether the current context is the main fiber or a secondary fiber.
     * 2. If it is the main fiber:
     *    - Use a blocking sleep (`std::this_thread::sleep_for`).
     * 3. If it is a secondary fiber:
     *    - Assign a unique identifier (`myId`) to the fiber.
     *    - Set up a one-shot timer that schedules a callback to un-yield the fiber after the specified duration.
     *    - Yield the current fiber, pausing its execution.
     *    - The fiber resumes when the timer's callback calls `SwCoreApplication::unYieldFiber`.
     *
     * ### Example:
     * ```cpp
     * SwEventLoop::swsleep(500); // Pauses execution for 500 milliseconds
     * ```
     *
     * @note This method integrates seamlessly with the fiber-based event loop system,
     *       enabling non-blocking delays.

     *
     * ### Workflow:
     * 1. A one-shot timer (`SwTimer::singleShot`) is triggered with a delay of `0`. This ensures that:
     *    - The runtime function starts immediately.
     *    - A new dedicated fiber is created for the runtime function, preventing the current fiber
     *      (calling this method) from being blocked.
     * 2. Inside the timer's callback:
     *    - The `swLocalLoop` macro is used to continuously call the provided function (`fn`) in an
     *      infinite loop.
     *    - Execution yields periodically to avoid blocking the application and to allow other tasks
     *      or events to execute.
     * 3. The runtime function continues until explicitly stopped or interrupted by other control
     *    mechanisms in the application.

     * ```cpp
     * SwEventLoop::installRuntime([]() {
     *     std::cout << "Executing continuous runtime task..." << std::endl;

     *
     * @note By triggering a one-shot timer, this method ensures that a dedicated fiber is created
     *       for the runtime function. This design prevents the current fiber from being blocked and
     *       allows the runtime task to operate independently.
     *
     * @warning The infinite nature of `swLocalLoop` means the function will run indefinitely unless
     *          explicitly stopped or interrupted. Ensure appropriate safeguards or stopping
     *          mechanisms are in place if needed.
