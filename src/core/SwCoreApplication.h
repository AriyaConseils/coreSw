/**
 * @brief Internal class representing a high-precision timer that executes a callback at specified intervals.
 *
 * The `_T` class is used internally by `SwCoreApplication` to manage timers. It allows scheduling
 * and execution of a callback function either as a recurring task or as a single-shot event.
 * The timer operates with microsecond precision, making it suitable for applications requiring
 * accurate timing.
 *
 * ### Key Features:
 * - **Callback Execution**:
 *   - Executes the provided callback function when the timer is ready.
 * - **Precision Timing**:
 *   - Tracks elapsed time with microsecond-level precision using `std::chrono::steady_clock`.
 * - **Timer Modes**:
 *   - Supports both recurring timers and single-shot timers.
 * - **Utility Functions**:
 *   - Determines readiness of the timer with `isReady`.
 *   - Calculates the time remaining until the timer is ready with `timeUntilReady`.
 *
 * ### Usage:
 * 1. Create an instance of `_T` with a callback function, interval (in microseconds), and
 *    an optional single-shot mode.
 * 2. Use `isReady` to check if the timer is ready for execution.
 * 3. Call `execute` to run the callback and reset the timer (for recurring timers).
 * 4. Use `timeUntilReady` to query the time remaining until the timer is ready.
 *
 * ### Example:
 * ```cpp
 * _T timer([]() { std::cout << "Timer fired!" << std::endl; }, 1000000, false); // 1-second recurring timer
 * if (timer.isReady()) {
 *     timer.execute();
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @note This class is designed to be lightweight and efficient for use in high-frequency event loops.
 *
 * @warning Instances of `_T` are not thread-safe. Ensure that the timer is managed within a
 *          thread-safe context (e.g., using mutexes) if accessed concurrently.

/**
 * @brief Main application class for managing an event-driven system with fiber-based multitasking.
 *
 * The `SwCoreApplication` class serves as the core of the application, providing an event loop,
 * timer management, and fiber-based cooperative multitasking. It allows for precise control over
 * the execution flow of tasks through mechanisms like `yield`, `unYield`, and fiber switching.
 * Additionally, it utilizes high-precision timers on Windows to ensure accurate timing for events
 * and tasks.
 *
 * ### Key Features:
 * - **Event Loop**:
 *   - Handles an event queue, processing functions and callbacks asynchronously.
 *   - Supports efficient task scheduling and execution.
 * - **Timer Management**:
 *   - Allows adding, removing, and managing timers with microsecond-level precision.
 *   - Supports single-shot and recurring timers.
 * - **Fiber-Based Multitasking**:
 *   - Implements cooperative multitasking using Windows fibers.
 *   - Provides `yieldFiber` and `unYieldFiber` for pausing and resuming task execution.
 *   - Ensures efficient resource management for fibers through mechanisms like `release` and `deleteFiberIfNeeded`.
 * - **High-Precision Timing**:
 *   - Uses multimedia timers on Windows for enhanced precision in timer scheduling.
 *   - Ensures consistent timing behavior across tasks and events.
 *
 * ### Workflow:
 * 1. The main event loop (`exec`) continuously processes events and manages timers.
 * 2. Tasks and timers are executed within fibers, allowing for non-blocking execution.
 * 3. Fibers can yield control back to the main loop and resume later as needed.
 * 4. Events and timers are handled with thread-safe mechanisms to ensure consistency in
 *    multi-threaded environments.
 *
 * ### Typical Usage:
 * - Instantiate the `SwCoreApplication` class.
 * - Use `postEvent` to enqueue tasks or events.
 * - Add timers with `addTimer` for time-based task scheduling.
 * - Start the main event loop with `exec` to process tasks and timers.
 *
 * @note This class is designed for applications requiring precise control over asynchronous tasks,
 *       such as real-time systems or applications with complex scheduling requirements.
 *
 * @warning This class heavily relies on Windows-specific APIs (fibers and multimedia timers).
 *          It is not portable to non-Windows platforms.

     *      event or timer expiration using a condition variable.
     *    - If an event is available, it is extracted from the queue and executed within a fiber
     *      using `runEventInFiber`. The function returns `0` after processing the event.
     * 2. **Timer Management**:
     *    - Iterates through the list of active timers and checks if they are ready to execute.
     *    - Executes callbacks for ready timers within fibers:
     *        - If the timer is single-shot, it is removed and deleted after execution.
     *        - If the timer is recurring, it remains in the timer list.
     *    - Updates the minimum time until the next timer is ready.
     * 3. **Fiber Management**:
     *    - Calls `resumeReadyFibers` to handle fibers that were previously paused and are now
     *      ready to run.
     * 4. **Return Value**:
     *    - If an event or a timer is processed, the function returns `0`.
     *    - Otherwise, it returns the time in microseconds until the next timer is ready, or a
     *      small default value if no timers are active.
     *
     * @param waitForEvent If `true`, blocks and waits for an event to arrive if the event queue and

     * @brief Restores a previously yielded fiber to the ready queue for execution.
     *
     * This function handles the transition of a fiber from the "yielded" state back to the "ready"
     * state. It locates the fiber associated with the specified identifier (`id`) in the
     * `s_yieldedFibers` map. If the fiber is found, it is removed from the yielded fibers map and
     * added to the `s_readyFibers` queue. Fibers in the ready queue will be resumed by the main
     * fiber during the event loop execution.
     *
     * ### Workflow:
     * 1. Lock the `s_yieldMutex` to safely access the `s_yieldedFibers` map.
     * 2. Search for the fiber using the provided `id`.
     * 3. If the fiber is found:
     *    - Extract and remove it from the `s_yieldedFibers` map.
     *    - Store the fiber pointer in a local variable.
     * 4. Lock the `s_readyMutex` to safely push the fiber into the `s_readyFibers` queue.
     * 5. If the fiber is not found in `s_yieldedFibers`, no operation is performed.
     *
     * @param id The unique identifier of the fiber to un-yield.
     *
     * @note This function ensures thread safety when modifying shared data structures by using
     *       `std::lock_guard` for both `s_yieldMutex` and `s_readyMutex`.
     *
     * @warning If the `id` provided does not correspond to any fiber in `s_yieldedFibers`, the
     *          function will exit silently without performing any operation.
     *
     * @remarks This function is designed to facilitate cooperative multitasking by enabling
     *          previously paused fibers to rejoin the execution flow. It is typically called
     *          when an external event signals that the fiber should continue its execution.
